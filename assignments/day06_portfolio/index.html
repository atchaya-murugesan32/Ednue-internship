              <h3>Project 1</h3>
              <p>Conventional libraries are having difficulty integrating various formats, including multimedia and e-resources
                because of outdated management systems. Inefficient cataloguing, resource tracking
                bottlenecks, and a lack of analytics tools hinder librarians from optimizing collections and improving user
                experiences.

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>Weather forecasting systems create precise predictions about the weather at a certain location and time
                    by combining science and technology. Applications and systems for weather forecasting make
                    predictions about the weather based on a variety of factors, including wind speed, humidity, temperature, pressure, and so forth.
